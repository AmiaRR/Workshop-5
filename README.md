# Workshop-5 

https://amiarr.github.io/Workshop-5/

The link to the webpage of this task does not work, I don't know why, as far as I can tell it looks the same as the rest of them. For this task I used excel sheets to create a dataset, and used VScode to create a bar graph and a bar graph with images. In a previous task I had failed to be able to include images in VScode, but it did suprisingly work in this task. Unfortunatly I was not able to repeat my success by including more different images, which would have allowed me to make more kinds of graphs, but I was still able to present my data in several different ways.
